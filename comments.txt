1. Moves Calculation Analysis:
Let     S := Number of Board Spaces (It's 64 but hey)
        P_b := Number of Black Pieces
        P_w := Number of White Pieces

The board is scanned once for each player to determine where their pieces are.
Time:
    Determining Locations  = O(2 * S)
Space:
    Determining Locatoins = O(S + P_b + P_w)

Each piece is tested in every direction for valid moves
For White:
    Time:
        Finding Valid Moves = O(4 * P_w)
    Space:
        Finding Valid Moves = O(4 * P_w)

For Black:
    Time:
        Finding Valid Moves = O(4 * P_b)
    Space:
        Finding Valid Moves = O(4 * P_b)

Therefore, once read in, the complexity of finding all valid moves is:
    Time:
        O(2 * S) + O(4 * P_w) + O(4 * P_b)
            = O(2*S + 4(P_w + P_b))
                Which is Linear

    Space:
        O(S + P_b + P_w) + O(4 * P_w) + O(4 * P_b)
            = O(S + 5(P_w + P_b))
                Which is Linear
